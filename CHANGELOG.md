# Changelog

## 0.1.0 (2026-09-28)

The first release.

- **Skills as graphs:** `skill.yaml` with six block types (`task`, `decision`, `parallel`, `script`, `call`, `end`), typed inputs and outputs, `{{ }}` computed values, visit caps, and nested skill calls.
- **The runner:** one packet per block, one `submit` command per answer (YAML on stdin), typed answer checks with plain-word errors, retries, pause and resume across sessions and harnesses, and an interactive or autonomous mode.
- **Harnesses:** Claude Code and Codex adapters (stubs, Stop and SessionStart hooks, a permission rule, parallel subagents), plus a `generic` adapter for any other harness.
- **Tools:** `validate`, `test` (a scripted fake agent), `sync`, `init`, `update`, and a read-only `view`er with a step-through timeline.
- **Proof skills:** `implement-issue`, `review-pr`, and `create-issue`, with 13 test cases.
